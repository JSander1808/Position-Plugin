# Positionator     +1.19.X

With this plugin, you can easily mark positions and save them for later use. The plugin provides you with two lists where you can store the positions.

The first list is public, allowing anyone on the server to access it and create, edit, or delete positions. This promotes collaborative sharing of positions among users.

The second list is private. Each user has their own private list where they can store their own positions, ensuring personalized management of positions.

When a player dies, a marker is automatically set at the corresponding position, enabling them to see where they died and find the location later.

You can also add saved positions to the BossBar, which displays the destination constantly, allowing you to easily navigate to the desired location.

Additionally, the plugin provides information about the dimension where the position is located. If you are in the same dimension as the marker, you will be shown the coordinates and distance to that position.

This plugin offers an efficient and user-friendly solution for marking, saving, and locating positions, enhancing your gaming experience.

It is also possible to divide the positions between the lists and you can save positions from the public list in your own private list and you can add positions from the private list to the public list.

## Step 7

If you press the beacon in the settings of the positions, you can make the position appear in the boss bar, which makes finding the position much easier.

The coordinates and the distance are displayed to you.
If you should be in a different dimension than the position, the boss bar only shows the dimension you have to go to in order to get to the position.
